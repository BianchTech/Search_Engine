## 🎯 Reason for Refactoring

<!-- Describe why this refactoring is necessary. What problem are we trying to solve? -->
Example:  
The current code works as expected but has issues such as maintainability challenges, tight coupling, or violations of best practices. Refactoring will ensure better quality, readability, and scalability for the future.

---

## 🔍 Current Code Description

<!-- Explain how the code is currently implemented and identify areas for improvement. -->
Example:  
- The `processData()` function has multiple responsibilities.  
- The `Module X` relies on several external classes, making reuse difficult.  
- There is inappropriate use of global variables.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

<!-- Describe how the code can be refactored to address the identified issues. -->
Example:  
1. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to split the function/module into smaller components.  
2. Remove global variables and replace them with dependency injection.  
3. Modularize the code to allow reuse in different contexts.

## 📈 Expected Impact

<!-- List the benefits this refactoring will bring. -->
Example:  
- Improve code readability.  
- Enhance test coverage and simplify the testing process.  
- Reduce coupling and improve modularity.  
- Make the system better prepared for future feature additions.
